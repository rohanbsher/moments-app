# Moments - AI Video Editor Implementation Checklist
**Goal:** Help people automatically edit their long videos into highlights based on what they want
**Vision:** "Upload your video, tell us what you want, get your edited video back"

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Product Vision

**Core Value Proposition:**
> "Turn your 30-minute video into a 3-minute highlight. Just tell us what moments you want - celebrations, action, quiet moments - and our AI finds them for you."

**User Story:**
> "I recorded my kid's 25-minute soccer game. I tell the app 'find the goals and exciting plays' and get a 2-minute highlight reel with all the best moments."
