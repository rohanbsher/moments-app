## üìã Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

### Step 1: Login to Railway (5 minutes)

```bash
railway login
```

This opens browser for GitHub OAuth. Railway CLI is already installed at:
`/Users/rohanbhandari/.nvm/versions/node/v20.5.0/bin/railway`

### Step 2: Deploy Backend (10 minutes)

#### Option A: Via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose `rohanbsher/moments-app`
5. Set root directory: `backend`
6. Railway will auto-deploy using railway.json config

#### Option B: Via CLI

```bash
cd /Users/rohanbhandari/Desktop/Professional_Projects/ML_PROJECTS_AI/moments_app
railway init
railway up
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment (2 minutes)

Once deployed, Railway will provide a URL like:
`https://moments-app-production.up.railway.app`

Test endpoints:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-url.up.railway.app/health

# API docs
open https://your-url.up.railway.app/docs
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "service": "Moments API"
}
```

## üîß Environment Variables (Optional - Later)

Railway will work with defaults initially. Add these later for production:

### PostgreSQL (when scaling)
```bash
# Railway provides this automatically when you add PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db
```

### Cloudflare R2 (when deploying iOS app)
```bash
STORAGE_TYPE=r2
R2_BUCKET=moments-videos
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
R2_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
R2_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Video Files Not in GitHub**
   - All .mp4, .mov, .avi files are gitignored
   - Repository size kept small (380KB)
   - Test videos stored locally only

2. **Production Database**
   - Currently using SQLite
   - Works for MVP and testing
   - Migrate to PostgreSQL before production launch

3. **File Storage**
   - Currently using local filesystem
   - Works for testing with small uploads
   - Must migrate to R2 before iOS app launch

4. **API Security**
   - CORS currently set to "*" (allow all)
   - Update to specific iOS app domain in production
   - Add authentication/rate limiting before public launch
