## 🔴 CRITICAL BUG FOUND

### Bug: Audio Not Preserved in Output

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Impact:** App unusable for musical/singing content
**Affected Users:** Anyone with videos containing important audio

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location:** `core/simple_processor.py:310-341`

**Problem:**
```python
def _create_output_video(self, input_path, segments, output_path):
    """Create output video using OpenCV"""

    # Uses cv2.VideoWriter which ONLY handles video frames
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
    out = cv2.VideoWriter(output_path, fourcc, fps, (width, height))

    # Writes frames but NO AUDIO
    for segment in segments:
        # ... copy frames ...
        out.write(frame)  # Only video, no audio!
```

**Why It's Broken:**
- OpenCV's `VideoWriter` class only handles **video frames**
- Audio tracks are completely ignored
- No audio encoding or muxing happens
- Output file has video but is **silent**

### Impact on User Value

**For Singing/Musical Content:**
- ❌ Completely unusable
- ❌ Defeats the entire purpose
- ❌ User gets silent video highlight
- ❌ Cannot share on social media

**For Other Content:**
- ⚠️ Still problematic for any video with important audio
- ⚠️ Meeting recaps lose speech
- ⚠️ Party videos lose music and chatter
- ⚠️ Nature videos lose ambient sounds

---

## 🔧 Recommended Fix

### Solution: Use FFmpeg for Video Composition

**Replace OpenCV with FFmpeg:**

```python
def _create_output_video_with_audio(self, input_path, segments, output_path):
    """Create output video WITH AUDIO using FFmpeg"""

    # Create filter_complex command for segment concatenation
    # This preserves BOTH video and audio streams

    filter_parts = []
    for i, segment in enumerate(segments):
        start = segment['start']
        duration = segment['end'] - segment['start']
        filter_parts.append(
            f"[0:v]trim=start={start}:duration={duration},setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v{i}];"
            f"[0:a]atrim=start={start}:duration={duration},asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a{i}]"
        )

    # Concatenate all segments with audio
    video_concat = ''.join(f"[v{i}]" for i in range(len(segments)))
    audio_concat = ''.join(f"[a{i}]" for i in range(len(segments)))

    filter_complex = (
        ';'.join(filter_parts) + ';' +
        f"{video_concat}concat=n={len(segments)}:v=1:a=0[outv];" +
        f"{audio_concat}concat=n={len(segments)}:v=0:a=1[outa]"
    )

    # Run FFmpeg with audio preservation
    cmd = [
        'ffmpeg', '-i', input_path,
        '-filter_complex', filter_complex,
        '-map', '[outv]', '-map', '[outa]',
        '-c:v', 'libx264', '-c:a', 'aac',
        '-y', output_path
    ]

    subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Preserves audio tracks
- ✅ Better video quality (libx264)
- ✅ Standard MP4 format
- ✅ AAC audio encoding
- ✅ Proper muxing of video+audio

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - Must fix before App Store launch**
