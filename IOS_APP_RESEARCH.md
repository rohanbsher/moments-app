# iOS App Development Research - Moments Video Highlighter
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Purpose:** In-depth analysis of building an iOS app for automatic video highlight generation

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research, building an iOS app for automatic video highlighting is **FEASIBLE but CHALLENGING**. The core algorithm works (proven with 17-minute test video), but porting to iOS requires significant architectural changes.

**Key Finding:** You CANNOT directly port Python/OpenCV code to iOS. You must either:
1. Rewrite the algorithm in Swift using AVFoundation/CoreML
2. Use cloud-based processing with the existing Python backend
3. Use OpenCV C++ with Objective-C++ bridging (complex)

## 1. Apple iOS Permissions & Policies

### ✅ Photo Library Access - ALLOWED

**Requirements:**
- Must add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` to Info.plist with clear explanation
- Request authorization: `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite)`
- iOS 14+ supports "Limited Access" - user can select specific photos/videos
- Authorization levels:
  - `.authorized` - Full library access (what we need)
  - `.limited` - User selects specific items only
  - `.denied` - User rejected access
  - `.restricted` - Parental controls blocking access

**For Our App:**
```swift
// Request full library access
PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite) { status in
    if status == .authorized {
        // Can access all videos
    }
}
```

**Info.plist Entry:**
```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Moments needs access to your videos to create automatic highlights from long recordings.</string>
```

### ✅ App Store Approval - NO BLOCKERS

**Apple's Requirements (2025):**
- Must use Xcode 16+ with iOS 18 SDK
- Video editing apps are explicitly allowed
- Must provide clear data usage descriptions
- Cannot deceive users about AI functionality
- Must offer meaningful functionality (not a niche-only app)

**Similar Approved Apps:**
- iMovie (Apple's own)
- CapCut (ByteDance)
- VN Video Editor
- InShot

**Our App Status:** ✅ Should pass App Store review
- Clear value proposition (compress long videos)
- No deceptive practices
- Standard photo library permissions
- Similar to existing approved apps

## 4. Python/OpenCV to iOS Portability

### ❌ CANNOT Use Python Directly

**Facts:**
- Python runtime not available on iOS
- Apple doesn't allow interpreted code in apps
- Our `.py` files cannot run on iPhone

### Options for Porting

#### A. Rewrite in Swift (BEST)

**What needs to be rewritten:**

```python
# Current Python code:
def detect_scenes(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    # Frame differencing logic...
```

**Becomes Swift:**

```swift
// Swift equivalent:
func detectScenes(videoURL: URL) {
    let asset = AVAsset(url: videoURL)
    let reader = try AVAssetReader(asset: asset)
    // Frame differencing using Vision framework...
}
```

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks for experienced iOS developer

#### B. Use OpenCV C++ via Objective-C++ Bridge

**Process:**
1. Compile OpenCV for iOS (~2MB app size increase)
2. Create Objective-C++ wrapper (.mm files)
3. Bridge to Swift

**Example:**
```objc++
// Objective-C++ wrapper
@implementation VideoProcessor
- (void)processVideo:(NSString *)path {
    cv::VideoCapture cap([path UTF8String]);
    // OpenCV C++ code here...
}
@end
```

**Pros:**
- Can reuse some logic
- OpenCV is battle-tested

**Cons:**
- Still requires significant rewrite
- Complex debugging
- Larger app size
- Not idiomatic iOS

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

#### C. Cloud Backend (EASIEST)

Keep Python code on server, iOS app just uploads/downloads.

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Why start with cloud:**
1. ✅ Reuse existing Python code (proven to work)
2. ✅ Faster time to market
3. ✅ Can validate user demand quickly
4. ✅ Consistent performance
5. ✅ Easier debugging

**MVP Features:**
1. Browse Videos from Photos library
2. Select video to process
3. Choose highlight duration (1, 3, or 5 minutes)
4. Upload to cloud → process → download
5. Save highlight back to Photos
6. Show processing progress

**Technology Stack:**
```
Frontend: Swift/SwiftUI
Backend: Python (FastAPI) on AWS/Railway
Storage: AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2
Processing: Our existing fast_process.py
```

**User Flow:**
```
1. User opens app
2. Sees their videos (PHPhotoLibrary)
3. Selects 17-min video
4. Chooses "3 minute highlight"
5. Taps "Create Highlight"
6. Video uploads (2-5 min on WiFi)
   → Shows progress: "Uploading... 45%"
7. Server processes (7 min)
   → Shows: "Analyzing video... Finding best moments"
8. Downloads highlight (30 sec)
   → Shows: "Almost done..."
9. Saves to Photos
10. Shows preview
```

**Estimated costs:**
- Development: 2-4 weeks
- Server: $80-150/month (for <100 users/month)
- Can increase pricing/limits as users grow

### Phase 2: On-Device Processing (Future)

Once we validate demand:
1. Rewrite core algorithm in Swift
2. Use Vision framework for scene detection
3. On-device processing as premium feature
4. Keep cloud as fallback

**Benefits:**
- Premium users get privacy
- Free users use cloud
- Best of both worlds
