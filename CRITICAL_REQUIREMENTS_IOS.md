# Critical Requirements for iOS App Development

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Priority:** HIGH - Required before starting iOS development
**Research Status:** Complete

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Based on in-depth research, **the #1 critical requirement** before building the iOS app is:

### **Deploy Backend to Production with HTTPS**

**Why this is THE top priority:**
1. iOS App Transport Security (ATS) **requires HTTPS** - no exceptions for production apps
2. You cannot test iOS app properly on localhost
3. Cannot submit to App Store without HTTPS backend
4. Development cycle will be blocked without it

**Bottom line:** iOS development cannot proceed effectively until the backend is deployed with HTTPS.

---

## üìã Critical Requirements (In Priority Order)

### 1. HTTPS Backend Deployment ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - BLOCKING**

**iOS App Transport Security (ATS) Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ HTTPS only (no HTTP)
- ‚úÖ TLS 1.2 or higher
- ‚úÖ SHA256 fingerprint minimum
- ‚úÖ 2048-bit RSA key or 256-bit ECC key
- ‚úÖ Forward secrecy ciphers

**Impact if not done:**
- ‚ùå Cannot test iOS app with real API
- ‚ùå Cannot submit to App Store
- ‚ùå Development will be theoretical only
- ‚ùå Cannot validate end-to-end workflow

**Solution:** Deploy to Railway or Render (both provide automatic HTTPS)

**Time to complete:** 2-4 hours

---

### 2. Cloud Storage for Videos ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current Issue:**
- Local storage won't work for production
- iOS app needs URLs to download processed videos
- Cannot use localhost URLs in iOS

**Cloudflare R2 vs AWS S3 Analysis:**

| Feature | Cloudflare R2 | AWS S3 |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Storage Cost** | $0.015/GB/month | $0.023/GB/month |
| **Egress Cost** | **$0 (FREE!)** | $0.09/GB |
| **Operations** | $4.50/M writes | $5.00/M writes |
| **Best For** | Video delivery | General storage |

**Example Cost (100GB storage, 500GB transfer/month):**
- **R2:** $1.50/month storage + $0 egress = **$1.50/month**
- **S3:** $2.30/month storage + $45 egress = **$47.30/month**

**Recommendation:** **Cloudflare R2** - Zero egress fees perfect for video delivery

**Time to complete:** 3-5 hours

---

### 3. Database Migration to PostgreSQL üî∂ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current Issue:**
- SQLite won't work in production (file-based)
- Need proper database for multi-user support
- Railway/Render both offer PostgreSQL

**Migration Path:**
```python
# Current: sqlite+aiosqlite:///./moments.db
# New:     postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db
```

**Impact if not done:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Won't scale beyond few users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concurrent access issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data integrity risks

**Solution:** Use Railway PostgreSQL ($0 for hobby, $5/month for production)

**Time to complete:** 2-3 hours

---

### 4. iOS Background Upload Support üî∂ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Requirements for iOS:**

**URLSession Background Configuration:**
```swift
let config = URLSessionConfiguration.background(
    withIdentifier: "com.moments.upload"
)
config.isDiscretionary = false  // Upload even in background
config.sessionSendsLaunchEvents = true  // Relaunch if terminated
```

**Backend Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Support resumable uploads (HTTP Range headers)
- ‚úÖ Handle chunked uploads (optional but recommended)
- ‚úÖ Return progress-friendly responses

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Our API already supports standard uploads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need to add resumable upload support

**Time to complete:** 4-6 hours (if implementing resumable uploads)

---

### 5. Push Notifications (APNs) üü¢ **LOW PRIORITY - Can wait**

**Purpose:** Notify user when processing complete

**Requirements:**
- Apple Developer certificates
- APNs integration in backend
- Device token handling

**Impact if not done:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users must manually check status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Poor UX but not blocking

**Recommendation:** Implement in Phase 2 of iOS app (after MVP working)

**Time to complete:** 6-8 hours

---

---

## üîß Backend Changes Needed

### 1. Environment Configuration

Add production environment variables:

```bash
# .env.production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db
STORAGE_TYPE=r2
R2_BUCKET=moments-videos
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
R2_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
R2_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

### 2. Storage Abstraction

Create storage service (already cloud-ready architecture):

```python
# app/services/storage.py

class StorageService:
    def __init__(self):
        if settings.STORAGE_TYPE == "r2":
            self.client = boto3.client(
                's3',
                endpoint_url=settings.S3_ENDPOINT,
                aws_access_key_id=settings.R2_ACCESS_KEY,
                aws_secret_access_key=settings.R2_SECRET_KEY
            )
        # else: local storage (current)

    async def upload_file(self, file_path, key):
        if settings.STORAGE_TYPE == "r2":
            self.client.upload_file(file_path, settings.R2_BUCKET, key)
            return f"https://pub-{settings.R2_ACCOUNT_ID}.r2.dev/{key}"
        else:
            # local storage (current behavior)
            return file_path

    async def get_download_url(self, key):
        if settings.STORAGE_TYPE == "r2":
            return self.client.generate_presigned_url(
                'get_object',
                Params={'Bucket': settings.R2_BUCKET, 'Key': key},
                ExpiresIn=3600
            )
        else:
            return f"/api/v1/jobs/{key}/download"
```

### 3. CORS Configuration

Update for iOS app:

```python
# app/main.py

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://moments-api.up.railway.app",  # Production API
        "http://localhost:8000",  # Local dev
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## üìä Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Address):

‚ùå **No HTTPS backend** - Blocks iOS development entirely
‚ùå **Local storage only** - Won't work in production

### Medium Risk (Should Address):

‚ö†Ô∏è **SQLite database** - Won't scale, but works for MVP
‚ö†Ô∏è **No resumable uploads** - Large videos might fail, but can retry

### Low Risk (Can Defer):

‚úÖ **No push notifications** - Poor UX but not blocking
‚úÖ **No CDN** - Slower downloads but acceptable for MVP

---

## üí° Key Insights from Research

### 1. iOS ATS is Non-Negotiable

> "ATS requires HTTPS with TLS 1.2+, SHA256 fingerprints, and forward secrecy ciphers. No exceptions for production apps."

**Translation:** Must deploy with HTTPS before iOS development can proceed effectively.

### 2. Cloudflare R2 is a No-Brainer for Video

> "100TB data transfer: AWS S3 costs $9,000/month in egress fees. Cloudflare R2: $0."

**Translation:** R2 saves $9,000/month on a moderately successful app. Use R2.

### 3. Railway > Render > Fly.io for FastAPI

> "Railway's simplicity and automatic HTTPS make it ideal for FastAPI. Render is more expensive but predictable. Fly.io requires Docker expertise."

**Translation:** Railway is the fastest path to production for our use case.

### 4. Background Uploads are Straightforward

> "iOS URLSession background configuration with isDiscretionary=false allows uploads even when app is suspended."

**Translation:** iOS handles background uploads natively. No special backend required.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**The critical path to iOS app development:**

1. Deploy backend to Railway (1-2 days) ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKS EVERYTHING**
2. Setup Cloudflare R2 (4-6 hours) üî∂ **BLOCKS PRODUCTION**
3. Migrate to PostgreSQL (2-3 hours) üî∂ **BLOCKS SCALE**
4. Start iOS development (6-8 weeks) ‚úÖ

**Total setup time:** 2-3 days of backend work before iOS development can start effectively.

**Cost:** $6-7/month for MVP, scaling to $35-40/month at 1,000 users.

**Recommendation:** Focus next 2-3 days on deploying backend infrastructure. Once that's done, iOS development can proceed smoothly without blockers.
