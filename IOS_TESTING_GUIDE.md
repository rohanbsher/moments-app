## üì± How to Test in Xcode

### Step 1: Run the App

**In Xcode:**
1. The project should already be open (`MomentsApp.xcodeproj`)
2. Select **iPhone 16 Pro** (or any iPhone simulator) from the device dropdown at the top
3. Click the **Play button** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) or press `Cmd + R`
4. Wait for the app to build and launch on the simulator

### Step 2: Add Test Videos to Simulator

You'll need some videos in the simulator's photo library to test with. Here are your options:

**Option A: Use Sample Videos (Recommended)**
1. When the simulator opens, drag and drop a video file directly onto the simulator window
2. Safari will open - click "Save Video"
3. The video will be saved to Photos

**Option B: Download Videos in Simulator**
1. Open Safari in the simulator
2. Search for "sample mp4 video" or use: https://sample-videos.com
3. Download a short video (5-30 seconds recommended for first test)
4. Save to Photos

**Option C: Use Your Test Videos**
I created a test video for you: `test_with_audio_30s.mp4` in the project root
- Drag this file onto the simulator
- Save it to Photos

### Step 3: Test the Complete User Flow

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution:**
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
2. Should return: `{"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","service":"Moments API"}`
3. If not, restart backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

### Issue: No videos in Photos library
**Solution:**
1. Drag the test video (`test_with_audio_30s.mp4`) onto the simulator
2. Or download a sample video from Safari in the simulator

### Issue: App crashes on launch
**Solution:**
1. Clean build: In Xcode, go to Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder
2. Rebuild: Press Cmd + B
3. Run again: Press Cmd + R

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:**
1. Close Xcode
2. Run: `xcodegen generate` in the `ios/` directory
3. Reopen Xcode and build again

### Issue: Upload gets stuck at 99%
**Solution:** This is normal! Wait a few seconds, the backend is processing the initial handshake.

### Issue: No audio in output (CRITICAL!)
**This should NOT happen anymore - the bug is fixed!**
If it does:
1. Stop the app
2. Check that the backend was restarted AFTER the FFmpeg fix
3. The backend logs should show: "Audio stream found" and "Building filter with audio preservation"

## üîç Technical Details (For Reference)

### What the App Does
1. **Upload:** Sends video file to backend via multipart/form-data POST
2. **Poll:** Checks job status every 1 second via GET request
3. **Download:** Downloads processed video when ready via GET request
4. **Save:** Saves video to iOS Photos library

### Backend Processing (What You're Testing)
1. Scene detection (PySceneDetect)
2. Motion analysis (OpenCV optical flow)
3. Audio intelligence (volume detection, excitement scoring)
4. Diversity scoring (prevents repetitive clips)
5. **FFmpeg composition (preserves audio!)** ‚úÖ

### API Endpoints Being Called
- `POST /api/v1/upload` - Upload video
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/status` - Check progress
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/download` - Download result

## üöÄ Ready to Test!

**Everything is set up for you:**
- ‚úÖ Backend running with audio preservation fix
- ‚úÖ iOS app configured for localhost
- ‚úÖ Xcode project ready to run

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start small:** Use the 30-second test video first
2. **Check audio:** This is the most important thing to verify!
3. **Try different videos:** Test with various content (music, speech, nature sounds)
4. **Test the flow multiple times:** Make sure it's reliable
5. **Save some results:** You can compare multiple highlight versions
