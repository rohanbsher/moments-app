# Testing Moments App on Your Physical iPhone

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for iPhone Testing
**Your Mac IP:** `192.168.0.8`
**Backend URL:** `http://192.168.0.8:8000`

---

## üéØ Why Test on iPhone?

Testing on your actual iPhone is **much better** than the simulator because:
- ‚úÖ Test with your **real videos** from your photo library
- ‚úÖ Test the **actual performance** on real hardware
- ‚úÖ Test **touch gestures** and interactions
- ‚úÖ See the **real user experience**
- ‚úÖ Test with **real network conditions**

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Hardware Setup
- ‚úÖ Your Mac (MacBook) - currently has IP `192.168.0.8`
- ‚úÖ Your iPhone (any model running iOS 17+)
- ‚úÖ USB cable (Lightning or USB-C depending on your iPhone model)
- ‚úÖ **Both devices on the same WiFi network** (CRITICAL!)

### 2. Software Requirements
- ‚úÖ Xcode already installed on your Mac
- ‚úÖ Backend running on your Mac at `http://192.168.0.8:8000`
- ‚úÖ iOS app configured with correct IP address

### 3. Network Setup
**IMPORTANT:** Your iPhone and Mac **must be on the same WiFi network**
- Check on Mac: Click WiFi icon in menu bar ‚Üí Note the network name
- Check on iPhone: Settings ‚Üí WiFi ‚Üí Verify same network name
- If different, connect both to the same WiFi

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Connect Your iPhone

1. **Plug in your iPhone** to your Mac using USB cable
2. **Unlock your iPhone**
3. **Trust this computer:**
   - Your iPhone will show: "Trust This Computer?"
   - Tap "Trust"
   - Enter your iPhone passcode if prompted
4. On your Mac, you may see a prompt to trust the device - click "Trust"

### Step 2: Open Xcode Project

The project should already be open. If not:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Professional_Projects/ML_PROJECTS_AI/moments_app/ios
open MomentsApp.xcodeproj
```

### Step 3: Select Your iPhone as Target

In Xcode:
1. Look at the **top toolbar**
2. Click the **device dropdown** (currently showing "iPhone 16 Pro" or similar)
3. You should see your iPhone listed (e.g., "Rohan's iPhone")
4. **Click your iPhone** to select it

**Note:** If you don't see your iPhone:
- Make sure it's plugged in and unlocked
- Make sure you clicked "Trust" on the iPhone
- Try unplugging and re-plugging the USB cable

### Step 4: Configure Code Signing

**This is REQUIRED for running on a physical device.**

1. In Xcode, click on **"MomentsApp"** in the left sidebar (the blue project icon)
2. Under "TARGETS", select **"MomentsApp"**
3. Click the **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
4. Check the box: **"Automatically manage signing"**
5. Under "Team", select **your Apple ID**
   - If you don't see your Apple ID:
     - Click "Add Account..."
     - Sign in with your Apple ID (the one you use for App Store)
     - Select it from the dropdown

**What this does:**
- Creates a development certificate
- Registers your iPhone for testing
- No paid Apple Developer Program needed for personal testing!

### Step 5: Fix Bundle Identifier (if needed)

If you see an error about "Bundle Identifier":
1. In the same "Signing & Capabilities" tab
2. Change "Bundle Identifier" from `com.moments.app` to something unique:
   - Example: `com.yourname.moments` (replace "yourname" with your actual name)
   - Example: `com.rohan.moments`

### Step 6: Build and Run

1. Make sure your iPhone is still selected in the device dropdown
2. Click the **Play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)** or press `Cmd + R`
3. Xcode will:
   - Build the app
   - Install it on your iPhone
   - Launch it automatically

**First time only:** Your iPhone may show "Untrusted Developer"
- Go to iPhone Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management
- Tap your Apple ID
- Tap "Trust [Your Name]"
- Tap "Trust" again to confirm
- Go back to home screen and tap the Moments app icon

## ‚úÖ Verify Backend Connectivity

### Before Testing the App

1. **Make sure backend is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.0.8:8000/health
   ```
   Should return:
   ```json
   {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","service":"Moments API"}
   ```

2. **Test from your iPhone's Safari** (optional but recommended):
   - Open Safari on your iPhone
   - Go to: `http://192.168.0.8:8000/health`
   - Should see the JSON response above
   - If you see "Safari cannot connect", check your WiFi (both devices must be on same network)

## üé¨ Testing Workflow

### Test 1: Quick Test with Short Video

1. **Open the Moments app** on your iPhone
2. Tap **"Create Highlight"**
3. Select a **short video** from your Photos (10-30 seconds recommended)
4. Watch the upload progress bar
5. Wait for processing (should take 5-15 seconds for short video)
6. **Play the result and CHECK FOR AUDIO** üîä
7. Tap "Save to Photos" if you want to keep it

**What to look for:**
- Upload should be fast (a few seconds)
- Processing progress should update smoothly
- **Result video should have AUDIO** ‚úÖ
- Video should play smoothly

### Test 2: Real User Scenario

1. Select a **longer video** (1-3 minutes) that you actually care about
2. Maybe a recent video from your camera roll
3. Set target duration to 60 seconds (or whatever you prefer)
4. Upload and process
5. **Verify the highlight captures the good moments**
6. **Verify audio is preserved**
7. Save to Photos

**What to look for:**
- App handles longer videos well
- Processing time is reasonable
- AI selects interesting moments (motion, audio)
- Output quality is good
- **Audio matches video** (no sync issues)

### Test 3: Multiple Videos

Try creating highlights from different types of videos:
- üé§ **Singing/music video** (critical - this is what the audio fix was for!)
- üèÉ **Sports/action video**
- üó£Ô∏è **Speech/talking video** (meeting, interview, etc.)
- üéâ **Party/celebration video**
- üåÖ **Nature/scenic video**

---

## üìä Performance Expectations

### Upload Times (on WiFi)
- Small video (< 10MB): < 1 second
- Medium video (10-50MB): 1-5 seconds
- Large video (50-200MB): 5-20 seconds
- Very large (> 200MB): 20-60 seconds

### Processing Times
- 30 second video: ~5-10 seconds
- 1 minute video: ~10-20 seconds
- 5 minute video: ~1-2 minutes
- 10 minute video: ~2-5 minutes

**Note:** First-time processing might be slightly slower due to model loading.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"

**Most common cause:** iPhone and Mac are on different WiFi networks

**Solution:**
1. Check WiFi on both devices (must be same network!)
2. Verify backend is running: `curl http://192.168.0.8:8000/health`
3. Test from iPhone Safari: `http://192.168.0.8:8000/health`
4. Check Mac firewall isn't blocking port 8000:
   - System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall
   - If enabled, click "Firewall Options" and allow incoming connections

### Issue: "Developer Mode Required" (iOS 16+)

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security
2. Scroll down to "Developer Mode"
3. Enable it
4. Restart your iPhone
5. Try running the app again

### Issue: "Untrusted Developer"

**Solution:**
1. Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management
2. Tap your Apple ID under "Developer App"
3. Tap "Trust [Your Name]"
4. Confirm

### Issue: Xcode says "Failed to prepare device for development"

**Solution:**
1. Unplug iPhone
2. Restart Xcode
3. Plug iPhone back in
4. Try again

### Issue: Video upload gets stuck

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're on WiFi (not cellular)
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Try a smaller video first
4. Restart the app

### Issue: No audio in output (CRITICAL!)

**This should NOT happen with the FFmpeg fix!**

If it does:
1. Check the input video actually has audio (play it in Photos)
2. Check backend logs - should show "Audio stream found"
3. Let me know immediately - this is the bug we just fixed!

## üé¨ What You Should See

### Successful Test Flow

1. **App launches:** Clean home screen with "Create Highlight" button
2. **Photo picker:** Opens iOS Photos app picker

## üîä CRITICAL: Audio Verification

**This is the most important thing to test!**

The whole point of the FFmpeg fix was to preserve audio. Here's how to verify:

### Before Creating Highlight
1. Play your original video in Photos
2. **Confirm it has audio**
3. Note what kind of audio (music, speech, ambient, etc.)

### After Creating Highlight
1. Play the highlight in the Moments app
2. **TURN UP VOLUME** üîä
3. **Verify you hear audio**
4. Confirm audio matches what was in original video
5. Check that audio is **in sync** with video

### Test These Specifically
- ‚úÖ Music video (singing, instrumental)
- ‚úÖ Speech video (talking, podcast, interview)
- ‚úÖ Action video (sports with crowd noise)
- ‚úÖ Party video (music + people talking)

**If any of these don't have audio in the output, tell me immediately!**
