## 🎯 What to Test

### Quick 5-Minute Test

1. Tap "Create Highlight" in the Moments app
2. Select a **short video** (10-30 seconds) from your iPhone Photos
3. Watch it upload and process (~10 seconds)
4. **Play the result - VERIFY AUDIO WORKS!** 🔊
5. If audio works, the bug fix is successful! ✅

### Full Test

- Try a longer video (1-3 minutes)
- Try a music/singing video (critical for audio testing!)
- Try videos with different types of audio (speech, music, ambient)
- Verify highlights capture interesting moments
- Verify processing time is acceptable

---

## 🔊 Critical Success Criteria

**Most important thing to verify:**

✅ **Output videos have AUDIO** (if input had audio)

This is the bug we just fixed with FFmpeg. If audio is missing, let me know immediately!
