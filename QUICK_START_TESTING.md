## ⚡️ 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Start Backend (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/rohanbhandari/Desktop/Professional_Projects/ML_PROJECTS_AI/moments_app

# Start backend
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Wait for**: `Application startup complete`

**Verify**: Open browser to http://192.168.0.5:8000/docs (should show API docs)

---

### Step 2: Force Clean Build (2 minutes)

**CRITICAL**: This fixes the IP address issue (old IP 192.168.0.11 → new IP 192.168.0.5)

1. **Open Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open ios/MomentsApp.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Select Your iPhone**:
   - Top toolbar → Select "iPhone 16 Pro Max (Rohan's iPhone)"

3. **Clean Build Folder**:
   - Press: `⌘ + Shift + K` (or Product → Clean Build Folder)
   - Wait for "Clean Succeeded" message

4. **Build & Run**:
   - Press: `⌘ + R` (or Product → Run)
   - Wait for app to install on iPhone (30-45 seconds)
   - App launches automatically

---

### Step 3: Quick Smoke Test (2 minutes)

**On your iPhone, verify**:

1. ✅ **Home Screen Loads**
   - AI-Powered badge at top (shimmering)
   - Wand icon pulsing
   - "Moments" title
   - "Select Video" button with gradient

2. ✅ **Upload Flow**
   - Tap "Select Video"
   - Feel haptic feedback (light vibration)
   - Photo picker opens
   - Select any short video

3. ✅ **Processing Screen**
   - Brain icon (🧠) floating
   - Progress bar animates
   - Status text updates:
     - "AI analyzing scenes..."
     - "Detecting faces and emotions..."
     - "Finding best moments..."
   - Percentage counts up 0% → 100%

4. ✅ **Success**
   - Green checkmark appears
   - "Highlight Ready!" message
   - Tap "View Highlight"
   - Video plays

**IF ALL 4 PASS**: Core functionality is working! 🎉

## 🔍 Verify Correct IP Address

**After starting upload in Step 3**:

1. In Xcode, open bottom panel (Console tab)
2. Look for network requests in logs
3. **MUST show**: `http://192.168.0.5:8000/api/v1/upload`
4. **MUST NOT show**: `http://192.168.0.11:8000` ❌

**If you see the old IP (.11)**:
1. Delete derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MomentsApp-*`
2. Quit Xcode completely
3. Reopen and repeat Step 2 (Clean + Build)

3. Check Xcode console for actual IP being used (must be .5 not .11)

### Animations Are Laggy
1. Close other apps on iPhone
2. In Xcode: Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run → Build Configuration → Release
