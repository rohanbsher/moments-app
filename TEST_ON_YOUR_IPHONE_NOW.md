# üì± Test Moments App on Your iPhone RIGHT NOW

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Expo Go Won't Work

**Your Moments app is a native Swift/iOS app, NOT a React Native/Expo app.**
- ‚ùå Cannot use Expo Go (incompatible technologies)
- ‚úÖ Use Xcode to install directly on your iPhone

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Setup (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Connect Your iPhone to Mac

```bash
# 1. Connect iPhone to Mac via USB cable
# 2. Unlock your iPhone
# 3. When prompted "Trust This Computer?" ‚Üí Tap "Trust"
# 4. Enter your iPhone passcode
```

### Step 2: Open Xcode Project

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Professional_Projects/ML_PROJECTS_AI/moments_app/ios
open MomentsApp.xcodeproj
```

**This will launch Xcode with the Moments project.**

### Step 3: Configure Code Signing in Xcode

1. **In Xcode, click on "MomentsApp" (blue icon) in left sidebar**
2. **Select "MomentsApp" target** (under TARGETS)
3. **Click "Signing & Capabilities" tab**
4. **Check "Automatically manage signing"**
5. **For "Team" dropdown:**
   - If you see your name ‚Üí Select it
   - If it says "None" ‚Üí Click "Add Account" ‚Üí Sign in with your Apple ID
   - After signing in, select your Apple ID as Team

Xcode will automatically create a free development certificate and provisioning profile.

### Step 4: Select Your iPhone as Destination

1. **At the TOP of Xcode window, find the device dropdown**
   - It probably says "iPhone 16 Pro" or similar
2. **Click the dropdown**
3. **Look for your actual iPhone name** (e.g., "Rohan's iPhone")
4. **Select your physical iPhone**
   - It should show a üì± icon next to it
   - May take a moment to prepare device

### Step 5: Build and Run on Your iPhone

```
Click the PLAY button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) at top-left of Xcode
OR
Press: Cmd + R
```

**Wait for build to complete (~30 seconds)**

### Step 6: Trust Developer on iPhone (First Time Only)

**If this is your first time installing:**

1. App will install but show "Untrusted Developer" when you try to open it
2. On your iPhone: **Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management**
3. Under "DEVELOPER APP", tap **your Apple ID email**
4. Tap **"Trust [Your Email]"**
5. Tap **"Trust"** in confirmation dialog
6. **Go back to home screen and launch Moments app**

### Step 7: Test the App!

‚úÖ Backend is already running at: `http://192.168.0.8:8000`
‚úÖ App is configured to use this IP address
‚úÖ Your iPhone and Mac are on the same WiFi

**Now test:**
1. Open Moments app on your iPhone
2. Tap "Select Video"
3. Choose a video from your Photos
4. Watch it upload and process
5. See your highlight!
