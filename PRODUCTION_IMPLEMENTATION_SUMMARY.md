## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Backend won't start on Railway
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs for errors
railway logs

# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Ensure DATABASE_URL is set (auto-set with PostgreSQL addon)
```

### Issue: iOS can't connect to backend
**Solution:**
1. Verify backend is running: `curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`
2. Check CORS: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*`
3. Update iOS production URL in `Environment.swift`
4. Clean build: Xcode → Product → Clean Build Folder

### Issue: Videos not processing
**Solution:**
1. Check storage volume is mounted: `/app/storage`
2. Verify FFmpeg is available: `railway run which ffmpeg`
3. Check logs: `railway logs | grep ERROR`
4. Ensure enough disk space

### Issue: Sentry not receiving errors
**Solution:**
1. Verify SENTRY_DSN is set correctly
2. Check sentry-sdk is installed
3. Test with intentional error:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1/nonexistent
