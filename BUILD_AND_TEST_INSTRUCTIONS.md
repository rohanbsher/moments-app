3. Press ‚åò+R to rebuild
4. If still showing old UI, delete app from iPhone first, then rebuild

### Issue: Upload times out

**Check:**
1. Backend running: `curl http://192.168.0.5:8000/api/v1/health`
2. iPhone on same WiFi as Mac
3. Check Xcode console - should show `192.168.0.5` not `192.168.0.11`

### Issue: Build fails in Xcode

**Screenshot the error and check:**
